#### **ft.linux_64.***:
  executable file of fractal, different release version could be downloaded from:https://github.com/fractalplatform/fractal/releases, in this case, we use 0.0.1.1 version for test.
  
```
ft.linux_64.0.0.1.1 --help   // get help info
```
If you are familiar with go language, you could download the souce code of fractal:
https://github.com/fractalplatform/fractal, then you can compile it and get the bin file.\
Compile command:

```
~/go/src/github.com/fractalplatform/fractal$ make all
```
You could get the bin file[ft] from ./build/bin dir. In this case, we rename ft to ft.linux_64. And you can rename other names which is just needed begin from "ft".

#### **genesis.json**: 
  genesis block's config file.

#### **oneStepStartAll.sh**: 
This script includes the functionality of  createGenesisNode.sh and start.sh. We could just run this file to start up the genesis node and other new nodes.  The command should be:
```
oneStepStartAll.sh localIp nodeNum p2pPort httpPort wsPort
```

-   **localIp**: the local ip address
-   **nodeNum**: the new node number, it doesn't include the genesis node.
-   **p2pPort**: the begining p2p port, the first new node will use the value of p2pPort, the second new node is p2pPort+1, and so on.
-   **httpPort**: the begining http port, the first new node will use the value of httpPort, the second new node is httpPort+1, and so on.
-   **wsPort**: the begining ws port, the first new node will use the value of wsPort, the second new node is wsPort+1, and so on.
  \
  for example: 

```
#./oneStepStartAll.sh 192.168.1.100 5 10000 11000 12000   // it will start up 5 new nodes, which p2p port is from 10000 to 10004, http port is from 11000 to 11004, ws port is from 12000 to 12004.
```


#### **createGenesisNode.sh**:

```
createGenesisNode.sh localIp
```
for example:

```
createGenesisNode.sh 192.168.1.100
```

  startup the genesis node, this script should be run before start.sh. And after running this script, you will get the genesis node info, such as: 
  
```
enode://1252e4edc7d1b57326e9e5fb00fec7ab7b2fde7359e7cbd027175e90512b6dd02a327b1fbedd6f28101dd6b3dfef2b6bcc8b58e44bf2e1c671c25a3955bd79a5@192.168.1.100:10000
```
\
Above whole string should be added to the nodes.txt which will be read by new node. New node will connect the genenis node by this node info.

#### nodes.txt
This file is generated by createGenesisNode.sh. The nodes which could be connected will written in this file. And new node will read this file then connect these nodes. The content of this file could be:
```
enode://1252e4edc7d1b57326e9e5fb00fec7ab7b2fde7359e7cbd027175e90512b6dd02a327b1fbedd6f28101dd6b3dfef2b6bcc8b58e44bf2e1c671c25a3955bd79a5@[::]:3018
enode://2252e4edc7d1b57326e9e5fb00fec7ab7b2fde7359e7cbd027175e90512b6dd02a327b1fbedd6f28101dd6b3dfef2b6bcc8b58e44bf2e1c671c25a3955bd79a6@192.168.2.11:3018
```

#### start.sh:
  start up new nodes, which will connect the genesis node. The command should be: \
  
```
start.sh nodeNum p2pPort httpPort wsPort
```

-   **nodeNum**: the new node number
-   **p2pPort**: the begining p2p port, the first new node will use the value of p2pPort, the second new node is p2pPort+1, and so on
-   **httpPort**: the begining http port, the first new node will use the value of httpPort, the second new node is httpPort+1, and so on
-   **wsPort**: the begining ws port, the first new node will use the value of wsPort, the second new node is wsPort+1, and so on.
  \
  for example: 

```
#./start.sh 5 10000 11000 12000   // it will start up 5 new nodes
```

  
#### stop.sh:
  stop the node which p2p port is specified by this script. The command should be:
  
```
stop.sh portStart portEnd
```

  the node which node is between [portStart, portEnd] will be closed.\
  for example: 

```
#./stop.sh 10000 10004   // it will close the node which p2p port between [10000, 10004]
```
